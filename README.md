To securely store files in a database, you can use a combination of SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) for data integrity and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) for encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and verification of data. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA):
Purpose:
SHA algorithms, like SHA-256, are used to generate a fixed-length hash value (a "fingerprint") of the data, ensuring data integrity.
How it works:
SHA algorithms take any input data and produce a unique, fixed-size output (the hash value). Any change to the original data, even a single bit, will result in a completely different hash value.
In a database context:
Before storing a file, you can calculate its SHA hash. When retrieving the file, you can recalculate the hash and compare it with the stored hash. If the hashes match, the data is considered to be intact; if they differ, it indicates that the file has been tampered with. 
2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
Purpose:
ECC is a public-key cryptography algorithm that provides strong encryption and decryption capabilities. 
How it works:
ECC uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. 
In a database context:
You can use ECC to encrypt the file data before storing it in the database, ensuring that only authorized users with the private key can decrypt and access the data. 
Advantages of ECC:
ECC offers strong security with smaller key sizes compared to other algorithms like RSA, making it efficient for resource-constrained environments. 
3. Combining SHA and ECC for Secure File Storage:
Data Integrity:
Use SHA to generate a hash of the file before storage, ensuring that the data remains unchanged. 
Confidentiality:
Use ECC to encrypt the file data before storing it in the database, protecting it from unauthorized access. 
Verification:
When retrieving the file, recalculate the SHA hash and compare it with the stored hash to verify data integrity. Decrypt the file using the ECC private key to access the original data. 
Example Scenario:
1. User uploads a file:
The system calculates the SHA hash of the file.
The file is encrypted using the ECC public key.
The encrypted file and the SHA hash are stored in the database.
2. User requests the file:
The system retrieves the encrypted file and the SHA hash from the database.
The system decrypts the file using the ECC private key.
The system recalculates the SHA hash of the decrypted file.
If the calculated hash matches the stored hash, the file is considered to be intact and is served to the user.
If the hashes do not match, the user is informed that the file has been tampered with.
